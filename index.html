            <p>Hello, my name is Tucker Little and I live on the big island of Hawaii. My wife and I own a custom embroidery business. We have three kids, and enjoy the outdoors. I like to paddleboard, surf, hike, play sports, and learn new things.</p>
            <p>I am currently a student of BYU-Idaho's online degree program studying software development.</p>
            <p>As active as I'd like to be, currently, I am focused on building my business, doing well in school and magnifying my calling. Any free time that I have is devoted to my family. We try to scedule beach days every other Monday and explore new places on the other Mondays.</p>
            <p>My wife and I were sealed to each other and our three kids in the Fresno, California temple. While we were living in Utah, my wife and I would regularly attend the Mount Timpanogos, Utah temple. It was a weekly date experience. At that time that temple still had its cafeteria open to patrons, so that would be our lunch date, then we would join our session. Now, our local temple is the Kona, Hawaii temple. Unfortunatly, it is currently under renovation. It is a lot harder for us to regularly attend the temple, but we make sure that we are able to visit one every time we go on a trip.</p>

            <p>Hawaii is the most secluded set of islands in the world and contains many beautiful wonders. It is a major tourist center, focused on the spirit of aloha. The big island of Hawaii is almost bigger than the rest of the islands combined. There is a lot of ourtdoor recreation to be had here.</p>
