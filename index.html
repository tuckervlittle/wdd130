            <p>Hello, my name is Tucker Little and I live on the big island of Hawaii. My wife and I own a custom embroidery business. We have three kids, and enjoy the outdoors. I like to paddleboard, surf, hike, play sports, and learn new things.</p>
            <p>I am currently a student of BYU-Idaho's online degree program studying software development.</p>
            <p>As active as I'd like to be, currently, I am focused on building my business, doing well in school and magnifying my calling. Any free time that I have is devoted to my family. We try to scedule beach days every other Monday and explore other places on the other Mondays.</p>
